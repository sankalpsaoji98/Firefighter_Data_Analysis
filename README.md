## Abstract
**Objective:**
Investigate the impact of fitness standards on firefighter fatalities, emphasizing state and firefighter-type variations.

**Methodology:**
Retrospective analysis of United States Fire Administration data.
Exploration of cardiovascular events rates among volunteer, career, and wildland firefighters.
Assessment of legislation effects using logistic regression and trend analysis.

**Findings:**
Volunteer firefighters are significantly more susceptible to cardiovascular events.
Legislation in California shows a decline in volunteer firefighter fatalities, while Tennessee exhibits mixed results.
Mixed outcomes attributed to poor compliance, high risk factors, and awareness variations.

**Implications:**
Crucial role of occupational health nurses in firefighter well-being and education.
Ongoing research needed to understand legislative impacts.
Emphasis on nuanced examination of fitness standards' impact on volunteer firefighter recruitment and retention.

## Data

**Source:**
The dataset is sourced from the United States Fire Administration's Firefighter Fatalities database, a transparent and regularly updated repository (https://apps.usfa.fema.gov/firefighter-fatalities/).

**Period Covered:**
The dataset spans from January 1, 1990, to December 31, 2021, providing a comprehensive 31-year timeframe for analysis.

**Data Cleaning:**
Rigorous data cleaning procedures were implemented, excluding cases occurring before January 1, 1990 (n=13) due to reporting inconsistencies.
Exclusion of cases related to historical events, such as those occurring in New York City on September 11, 2001 (n=346), and fatalities attributed to COVID-19 (n=99) between 2020-2023 to mitigate historical biases.

**Dataset Characteristics:**
The final dataset comprises 3,184 firefighter fatalities, providing a robust sample for analysis.
Information includes date of the incident, date of death, age, classification (volunteer, career, wildland), cause of fatal injury, nature of fatal injury, task during the fatal injury, and location (city and state) of the firefighterâ€™s department.

**Classification Simplification:**
Firefighters were classified into three broad categories: volunteer, career, and wildland, streamlining the analysis process.
Volunteer firefighters, who serve rural and suburban communities for little to no pay, constitute a significant portion (~65%) of the dataset.

**Limitations:**
Heterogeneity exists between state laws regarding firefighter physical fitness requirements, posing challenges in comprehensive analysis.
The dataset lacks individual-level data on comorbidities, biological sex, and other factors associated with cardiovascular events, limiting a more detailed examination.

**Data Analysis Tools:**
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (Version 29; IBM, Armonk, NY), employing logistic regression, ANOVA, and trend assessments to derive meaningful insights.

**Fitness Standards Identification:**
Law ChatGPT and OSHA-approved state plans were utilized to systematically analyze each state's provisions for volunteer firefighters' fitness testing requirements.

**Fitness Test Standardization:**
The study considers fitness test standardization across California and Tennessee, where the Candidate Physical Ability Test (CPAT) is widely accepted by both volunteer and career fire departments.

**Wildland Firefighter Fitness Assessment:**
Distinct fitness requirements for wildland firefighters, assessed through the rigorous Work Capacity Test, involving a 3-mile walk with a 45-pound pack within 45 minutes.

**Geographical Variation Analysis:**
Examination of cardiovascular events includes a geographical breakdown, showcasing variations in fatalities across states.
Special attention is given to New York, California, and Tennessee due to their differing legislative landscapes regarding fitness standards.

**Data Privacy and Ethics:**
The study adheres to ethical guidelines, ensuring the protection of sensitive information, and has been deemed exempt from human subjects research review due to the use of publicly available data.
